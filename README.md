# llama-stack in Open Data Hub

We do not use the `main` branch of this repository.

For Open Data Hub 2.22, see the `rhoai-v2.22` branch, and especially the [redhat-distribution directory](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack/tree/rhoai-v2.22/redhat-distribution)

ODH 2.22 is the final version that uses this repository. We do not expect to create new branches in this repository.

Future versions of RH OpenShift AI will use another system for `llama-stack` maintenance.

We continue to host the midstream [llama-stack-k8s-operator repo on ODH](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/llama-stack-k8s-operator).
